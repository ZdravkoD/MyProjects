This project is used to represent the Tower of Hanoi problem.

This project is developed under C++ Builder XE7. It uses the cross-platfrom GUI framework Firemonkey.

It waits for the user to input the number of disk in range [1;15] after what it calculates the number of moves it needs to move all disks from one column to another and calculates EACH step that needs to be taken. After clicking on the "move" button it starts moving the disks. 
You can set the speed of the animation of each disk with the buttons provided on the GUI form.
